# Day 1

The LPIC 1 Certification is divided in two parts, 101-500 and 102-500.
Hereby the 500 indicates that we are talking about the 5th version of the exam.
Both exams are 90 minutes long and feature 60 questions. 
Non-Native speakers get an extra 30 minutes to answer all questions.
Minimal amount of points needed to pass are 500 out of 800.

### Methodology

Since topics are publicly assigned a specific weight, it's possible to apply some sort of pareto distribution?
The information in question can be found here: https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/LPIC-1_Objectives_V5.0
According to the official studyguide you should further try to use Fedora 29, Ubuntu 18.04 or CentOS 7 as the questions are tailored to it specifically.


### Practical Calculation

Given: 60 Exam Points, 800 Max Score, 500 Passing Score

Means: 

800 / 100 = 8
500 / 8 = 62.5 

60 / 100 = 0.6
0.6 * 62.5 = 37.5 ~ 38


Result: 38 Exam points are required to pass
