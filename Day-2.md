# Day 2

Decided to follow some udemy course to see where it's going.
Learned that the Linux Kernel is licensed under GNU-GPL v2.0.
Turns out that license was designed by Richard Stallmann.
Same guy founded the Free Software Foundation. 
Turns out GNU stands for GNU is not Unix.
GNU-GPL seems to be a copy-left license.
BSD License in contrast allows for commercial closed source usage.
The Linux Kernel also seems to be a monolith, with dynamically loaded modules such as drivers for example.
Additionally most Linux Distros seem to be multi-arch and multi-user too... (Looking at you Windows...)
Furthermore Linux Distros seem to adjust some Kernel Parameters according to their use-case.
Most of them also follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and some follow Linux Standard Base.
This allows for a more streamlined work when in a multi-distro environment.
